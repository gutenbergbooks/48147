    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;BENSON AND CREE&mdash;THE COMMODORE INN, FORE AND AFT;
      AND A POINT STATED BY MY UNCLE BENSON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f anyone would
      understand how Ben Cree comes to be what he is for better or worse, he
      should know first the Commodore Inn and what it meant in those days to
      have the great wharves for a playground. And I cannot conceive to this day
      how one can amuse oneself, or be satisfied with any neat door-yard or
      inland village street, unless one is born a girl with a starched pinafore,
      which I should think would be a pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, then, you should picture the Commodore Inn; its red bricks streaked
      with the rain and the beat of damp winds; its high veranda, with the paint
      coming off the white pillars, and the worn stone steps leading underneath.
      In front is the brick sidewalk, the cobbled street, the bit of open space
      with Harrier's junk-shop on the right corner; and then the warehouses on
      either side, all leading down to the slip, Doty's Slip, which is flanked
      by noble wharves, with huge piles leaning awry and very slippery. The
      warehouses are roomy and full of queer smells, as if the varied
      merchandize of fifty years had left something for its old friends, the
      warehouses, to remember it by. The contents of these warehouses changed
      continually: cotton, tobacco, slabs of crude rubber, and multitudes of
      boxes whose contents might be learned sometimes by asking the
      wharf-master, if you did not mind his cuffing you on the ears. Next there
      would be the river and its hurrying tides, its choppy waves, the
      ferryboats, sailboats, and tugs going to and fro: to right and left&mdash;seen
      well by climbing the warehouse roofs&mdash;are masts of many ships with
      innumerable amusing ropes, other wharves with the like slippery brown
      piles and dark places underneath where the water thieves hid and bored
      holes up through the planks into the molasses barrels. Mr. Hooley, the
      wharf policeman, told me of that, and there was much that was attractive
      in it. For there was a time, before my ideas became settled, when I
      thought of many different careers. To be a wharf policeman seemed too
      ambitious a thought, too vain and far away; so that I asked Mr. Hooley's
      advice about water thieving, having respect for his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, Bennie Ben,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;'tis low. 'Tis not for the son of yer father,
      an' yer mother a lady as was ever bor-rn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I could be a wharf policeman, Mr. Hooley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, looking mysterious, &ldquo;who knows that? Don't ye let young
      Dillon lick ye, an' maybe&mdash;but 'tis a long way fer ye to grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I was speaking of the river. The navy yard lay nearly opposite, and
      the Wallabout, as that water is called behind the Government Cob Dock. And
      that stretch of busy river, with its tumult and tides, I love still no
      less, and love the thick smell of the wharves and warehouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      My two grandfathers, Benson and Cree, were shipping merchants together,
      &ldquo;Benson &amp; Cree,&rdquo; long ago, when you did not have to go beyond the
      Harlem for a bit of country. Indeed, my Grandmother Cree, I am told, had a
      great flower and vegetable garden, and there was an orchard behind the
      house, where in my time was but a little yard. The house was built for
      some colonial gentleman's residence, and my grandfathers bought it when
      prosperity came to them. And there they lived together with their
      families, and there were my father and mother born, for they were cousins,
      and also Uncle Benson and the two others who went down off Barnegat: a
      great, warmhearted house, red-walled and white-pillared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firm in its best days owned five ships. And by an odd arrangement one
      of them was always sailed by a member of the firm. They had their turns,
      one abroad and one at home. From this came the rhyme,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Benson and Cree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      One at home and one at sea&rdquo;;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      my father used to sing it, when absent-minded, to a queer haphazard tune.
      And I have heard Harrier, the junk-shop man, sing it too. But my father,
      if he saw me listening, would stop and seem ashamed, which I could not
      explain at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was an only child, and my mother an only daughter, but there
      were once three Benson boys. I am not sure of my Grandfather Cree, nor of
      my two grandmothers, at what dates they died, but in the year 1838 three
      of the five ships were lost: one of them with Grandfather Benson (in what
      waters is unknown), one of them with two of his sons off Bamegat, and one
      of them left a tilted wreck in the mid-Atlantic. And that same year my
      father made his last voyage, though still young in a way; for he came back
      with his knee crushed by the smack of a loose spar in a heavy sea, and
      walked with a crutch forever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my time came, there was no firm of Benson &amp; Cree. Our fortunes
      had not fallen altogether, but were moderate enough. Only three persons
      remained of the two families. Uncle Ben Benson was captain and part owner
      of the <i>Saratoga</i>, a good ship, carrying steam and sail, and landing
      merchandize at Doty's Slip. The house was now the Commodore Inn, kept by
      Tom Cree, my father. Ah, that was a brave man, loud-voiced, joyful! I
      believe I would break my knee willingly, and carry a crutch to the end of
      my days, to be so good a man, so simple and full of the pleasure of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was singularly quiet in her ways, but I think the success of the
      Commodore came from my father's popularity and my mother's management, and
      it was her hand that was on the tiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, speaking of the Commodore as if it were a ship, I come to what is
      properly the beginning of this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few of those who came to the Commodore&mdash;and they were mostly
      seafaring folk of the better class&mdash;ever saw my mother. She never
      appeared on the front porch with the pillars, where my father sat often
      and shouted heartily to any friend in sight; but she was always above, and
      often in her sewing-room that looked out on the little garden in the rear.
      I never knew her to come out of the front door, or to look from the
      windows on the slip; but whenever she went abroad it was through the back
      door and the little garden, gliding so quietly, so gently, that it seemed
      wonderful to me, who could not move, any more than could my father,
      without a thunderous racket. I can see her plainly, with her black shawl
      and sweet still face under an overhanging bonnet, going out through the
      little garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      How early or in what way I learned it I am not sure, but it seems as if it
      had always been a settled thing that I must not speak to her of the slip,
      or the river, or the ships, or anything in view from the front porch; but
      things which could be seen from the windows of her sewing-room, the
      garden, the people in the other street, the carriages and 'busses,
      steeples and distant roofs, these I might talk about. When Uncle Benson
      came home, once a year perhaps, the difference between the porch or inn
      parlour and the sewing-room was notable. For below the talk was all of the
      sea, winds, and islands, and full queer phrases of the shipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father loud and merry, and my uncle full of dry stories; my father's
      huge beard rumpled on his chest with laughter; Uncle Benson, as always
      when ashore, clean shaven and very natty in his clothes. But when we went
      above to the sewing-room, my mother would make tea on the hob, while the
      two men played backgammon, and you would have thought, for all that was
      said of it, that there was no sea at all, flowing and wrapped about the
      world. It was all quiet talk of the house, the new minister at the
      Broadway Church, and how it were well for Bennie to mind better his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this did not seem strange to me until it was explained, and then it
      seemed strange. For the things one is accustomed to when a little child
      appear only a part of common nature, whatever they are, and no more to be
      wondered at than tides and the flight of gulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had learned the story of that sudden, disastrous year, '38, though not
      from my father. He was a man curiously without shrewdness to suspect what
      I might be thinking, and without that kind of courage&mdash;if I may say
      so with affection&mdash;which enables a man to approach at need a subject
      which is sad or sore to him inwardly. So that, while I had my own
      thoughts, the thing was not all explained till I was a well-grown, clumsy
      lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this while it had come slowly upon me, until at last it was a great
      conviction, that I must be neither a water-thief, nor policeman, nor a
      doctor driving his carriage, nor a preacher in a carpeted pulpit, but a
      seaman and sometime a ship-captain like Uncle Benson, which idea became a
      hunger and thirst. But when I told my father of it, he looked at me
      queerly, and told me to mind my books. And I noticed that he would talk no
      more of sea matters when I was near, and would send me away from the inn
      parlour to go up to the sewing-room. So, whenever I pressed him to say I
      was to be a sailor, he would put it aside with a look on his face that
      puzzled me, for it was not only sadness, but fear. The sweat would come on
      his forehead and his hand shake. I think I was little comfort to anyone in
      those days, knocking about the streets and wharves, idle, sullen, and
      restless, wronging those in my thoughts who loved me most.
    </p>
    <p>
      That old song I took to humming to myself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Benson and Cree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      One at home and one at sea,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      till I had fairly got it changed, so that it ran&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Bennie Ben Cree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Come away to the sea,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and the lilt of the tune never failed to put a beating in my ears and a
      burning in my eyes, and fill my head with foolish fancies. I would sing it
      to Harrier in his shop, and Harrier would say, &ldquo;Aye, aye, sonny! Them's
      new words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was come the year '61; and late in the month of May the <i>Saratoga</i>
      lay in the slip being fitted out for government use to blockade Southern
      ports, and sometime, then or later, was towed across to the navy yard. She
      was sold to the service, with the option of repurchase if not destroyed,
      and Uncle Benson was enlisted to command her, and looked a fit proper man
      in his uniform, which excited me almost beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I am come to a scene in the little inn parlour behind the public room.
      It was my father's office, and in a manner his room of state. You should
      see in mind a square room with pleasant curtains and a gay carpet on the
      floor, a round stove with no fire in it at this time; there are six or
      eight stout chairs of varied shape, about the number of my father's
      cronies, who came evenings to pack themselves in, and make the air white
      with smoke and salty with old sea memories. In the corner is a snug desk,
      and about the walls models of &ldquo;Benson &amp; Cree's&rdquo; five ships; portraits
      of the family, and a painting of an unlikely looking coast; on one side
      shelves with a few books, but mainly pink and white shells, and stuffed
      fishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Benson and my father are sitting looking at me, who am standing
      awkwardly enough and shifting my feet about. Uncle Benson is saying,
      &ldquo;We're going to put it to you, Ben,&rdquo; and my father bursts in nervously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it, Ben. We're going to put it to you, just how it is, don't you
      see?&rdquo; My uncle coughed, and beginning in an oddly stiff and formal way
      told the story of the year 1838, for the most part what I knew already, as
      I told him, not meaning to be impolite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, Ben,&rdquo; said he, quietly, &ldquo;but I'm going on. You don't know that your
      mother, for a year or more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen months,&rdquo; said my father, leaning forward and speaking huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen months. Well, well, a wonderful woman, your mother, but women
      take trouble different ways. Some take it hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at them, bewildered enough, while they looked long at each other,
      seeming to take comfort from it. Uncle Benson, leaning forward, touched my
      father's knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and me, Tom, we most gave it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And my father pulled his beard fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gave what up?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said my father with a start, &ldquo;we're going to put it to you, Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Uncle Benson softly, &ldquo;'twas a shock she had, 'twas a tough
      time, and you weren't a man, Tom, to see what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good at all,&rdquo; said my father, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they fell to looking at each other, and there seemed to be no ending
      of my impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Uncle Benson at last, &ldquo;but we're not putting it to you, Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;we're going to put it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And my uncle went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen months it was, and right you are. A moaning, trembling, walking
      the floor like one as has a bad dream and no let up. Wrong, wrong in her
      head, and by times very wild, Ben, and suffering terrible with fancies; by
      times not knowing anyone, and always it was some one going down with the
      seas clapping over him. She said the sea was hungry and cruel, Ben, having
      her fancies, poor woman. She used to tell a-whispering, how she could hear
      the big seas mad and raging all about her, and at other times little waves
      on the beach, like a beast sipping and licking its lips. Fancies she had
      very odd. And when you were born it came back again, but only for a few
      weeks. And other whiles it has been as we see now, quite right. But she
      would so shrink and tremble at any speaking of the sea that we quit saying
      anything, as you know well, and I hope and trust she has had no pain from
      that, nor looked upon salt water, these twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now it's put to you, Ben, for you want to go out with me, and I'm
      thinking for the matter of the war she'd be no more than other women
      perhaps, but for the rest it's different. And now we've put it to you,
      we'll ask what you think.&rdquo; I was fumbling with my jacket, struggling not
      to see how the case stood, which nevertheless seemed clear enough, and my
      eyes were hot with thinking of things greater and stranger than I had
      known before. &ldquo;I think as you do,&rdquo; I said at last, as stiff and steady as
      I could make out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and that's all right. But I'll tell you what I think.
      We've been saying, he and I, it might come all right in time, and if a Ben
      Benson Cree must be a landsman after all he should have the credit of
      seeing the thing for himself, and what was reasonable and right. That's
      how we put it. But now it's been many years, and a man can't tell but
      things may be quiet, and she might make no trouble at all. A man can't
      tell, now, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; my father burst in nervously. &ldquo;How can he? We put it to you,
      how can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's a job I don't hanker for, but I'm going to do it for you, Ben,
      sort of hitch it in with conversation, sort of by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;You hitch it in sort of by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle stood up, buttoned his coat, and went softly from the room..
    </p>
    <p>
      My father sat quite silent, but his face was full of trouble and fear,
      like that of a child who is frightened at the wind or the dark, though in
      a bodily sense I suppose he was a man that never feared anything. He pawed
      his great beard with a shaking hand, a hand bigger than mine is now, which
      is no small affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we waited for a time that no doubt seemed longer than it was; I do not
      know how long, or what Uncle Benson said by way of conversation. But at
      last there was a sudden cry and something fell, jarring the floor with a
      dull, soft sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father jumped forward. I shot past him and up the stairway, he
      struggling and thumping behind with his crutch. In the sewing-room Uncle
      Benson was lifting my mother to the sofa. She lay with her hands to her
      face, murmuring, moaning, in a swift incessant way to make one shiver,
      with her pretty bright hair loose on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried my uncle, sharply. &ldquo;Tell her it won't be. Quick, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fell on my knees beside her crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never go, if you don't like, never, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The murmuring and moaning ceased gradually. She took both hands from her
      face and put them around my neck, and my father and Uncle Benson, bending
      over her, gave a great sigh that was like a sob, both together; and
      looking up I saw my father gripping the other's shoulder, as if to hold
      himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two fools, Tom, two fools,&rdquo; said Uncle Benson grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then my father did what I think was an odd thing, but keen; for he stumped
      over to the cupboard and brought out the backgammon board. And there they
      played backgammon it might be an hour, making their points vigorously with
      great racket, as if nothing else could interest them, my mother the while
      holding hard to my rough head.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the <i>Saratoga</i> sailed away in due time, and left me behind to make
      a poor pretense at books, but to get along better when the summer came,
      with helping in the business of the inn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;LACRIMÆ RERUM&mdash;THE THREE MEN IN THE PUBLIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was in the
      latter part of September that I first observed the three strangers at the
      corner table in the public room, though they may have been there before.
      Afterwards, whenever passing through, I would look for them, and they were
      noticeable men; the eldest of the three an easy-looking gentleman with an
      air of commanding and greyish hair and beard; the second, who always sat
      beside him against the wall, was odd and humorous in his manner and had a
      look of imperturbable happiness, round faced, smooth-shaven, with straight
      hair and rather long, thin lips sticking out when something amused him, a
      well-muscled, large-framed man; the third stranger always sat opposite the
      others, with his back and square, slender shoulders to the rest of the
      room. And when all three men were there, the first two seemed to talk to
      the third loudly and genially; but sometimes these two came alone, and
      then they talked to each other and were more quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon I stood within the door that led from the long verandah to
      the hall and floor above, the door of the public close beside it; and my
      father was asleep in his chair far at the other end of the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the three strangers come to the door of the public, heard the
      third say good-by, not two yards from my ear, and go down the steps
      briskly. And in a moment the elder stranger spoke thus in a drawling way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's close, Dan, he is. He takes a man's confidence like it belonged to
      him natchully, but he don't appear to have any opinion on it. Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks are diff'ent, cap,&rdquo; said the other blandly. &ldquo;You don' expect a
      te'apin to open hisself. He can't 'ithout bustin', an' he may be a very
      good sort of te'apin an' a warm-hearted te'apin. An' another man comes
      along whoopin', 'How d'ye do! Here's me. Who are you?' like he couldn't
      help his candor, Ever hear o' the snake in the gyarden o' Eden, cap? He
      was very co'dial, that snake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;I shan't open on him till the time comes, He can
      have his choice then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how, cap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here. Offshore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that they went down the steps also. My father woke with the noise,
      and they nodded to him pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time Tony, the waiter in the public, came out and winked at me
      wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those fellies is fittin' a ship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Say, she's jus' goin' in der
      navvy yard. Say, I hear 'em tell she's a keener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father only gazed down the slip with absent, pathetic eyes, thinking,
      as always, those September days, of what was slipping away from us in the
      white-curtained room above that looked out on the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think of the thing we call death in a general way, spelling it
      maybe with a capital, it never seems to me a going down at sea&mdash;and I
      have seen that&mdash;or any violent accident; but it seems like a
      white-curtained room with a little breeze blowing the curtain in, and
      outside you hear the rattle and mutter of the city, as though it were
      making comments on the matter in a hoarse undertone. A broad white bed is
      near the wall, the doctor and nurse are sometimes in and out of the room,
      and on the pillows is a thin white face with the hair drawn neatly back.
      The lips are moving with a faint sound, and the eyes look out softly and
      peacefully, at me kneeling beside, and my father sitting with his chin on
      his crutch and his beard rumpled. There is a lost look in his eyes, wide
      and lonely; like a man under whom a ship is going down at sunset, who sees
      the sun for the last time and the red clouds doing his burial service. My
      mother is speaking; her voice is not like any sound that seems natural to
      the earth, but thin, creeping, and slow, like the mists you see in the
      early morning that cling and whisper to slack sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were always my big boy, Tom,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;like Ben, only bigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben's growing,&rdquo; says my father, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not remember it against me, Ben, for it was not I. And he shall go
      to sea, Tom, remember, like all the Bensons and Crees, all sailing folk
      and proud to be, proud to be all sailing folk. But I'm glad you're not a
      woman, Ben, for the sea's hard on women, very hard.&rdquo; When I went to school
      in the brick schoolhouse on Willet Street I studied Latin in a
      green-covered book of selections, which for the most part I greatly
      disliked. There was a passage ending with these words, &ldquo;sunt lacrimæ
      rerum&rdquo;; and what &ldquo;lacrimæ rerum&rdquo; means I find less easy to say in common
      English than I did then, when we called it &ldquo;the tears of things,&rdquo; and
      appeared to satisfy the master with that. But now I suppose it might mean,
      there is a hidden sorrow in the middle of God's universe that likely has
      been there always. However it may be, I suppose it quite beyond a plain
      man to describe his idea of the matter. But whenever I think of those
      words, &ldquo;lacrimæ rerum,&rdquo; they sound to me as if spoken in my mother's
      voice, sighing, plaintive, and moving away from me; or as if she might
      have meant the same thing in saying, &ldquo;The sea's hard on women, very hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew the curtain in so that it wavered in the room. &ldquo;Lacrimæ
      rerum. The sea's hard on women,&rdquo; a kind of sighing sound that moved far
      and far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now come to the latter part of November, and about the middle of a
      certain morning I heard Tony calling my name. At my coming he winked in a
      manner to make me think he knew all about something, only that he always
      winked to show his knowingness, whether he knew anything or not. He
      pointed with his thumb to the door of the inn parlour, where I went in,
      and found my father sitting with the three strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their names, as I came to hear them, were these: the eldest, Captain
      Cavarly; the odd-looking one, Mr. Dan Morgan; and the third, Mr. Sabre
      Calhoun&mdash;a curious name, and he was tall and thin, and, like his
      name, not to be quickly forgotten. Indeed, he was a man I never
      understood, and, seeing that I came to have such chances of knowing him as
      do not commonly fall between men, there must have been something odd with
      him or with me. He had sandy hair, and grey eyes that seemed very lively
      and shrewd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you acquainted with these gentlemen,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;if the
      captain don't mind your hearing his yarn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shuly,&rdquo; said he, with a fine wave of his hand. &ldquo;Glad to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Calhoun nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why,&rdquo; said Mr. Morgan, looking at my red cheeks. &ldquo;You ain't got any
      liver complaint. Well, sir, when I was so old I used to bust the seams o'
      my clo'es, an' it hurt my feelins te'ible. I grew like a yellow punkin,
      ve'y similar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain went on with the story, which my coming had interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, then I started for Washington in a hurry, to see the Sec'etary
      o' the Navy, an ol' gen'lman from hereabout 'ith a beard like a palm leaf
      fan, yes, sir; an' I said to him, 'Sir, this country is fairly leakin 'ith
      pat'iotism. Here's parties, that don't wish their names known for private
      reasons&mdash;say they're Baltimore parties, but they want me to tell you,
      'Here's the <i>Octarara</i> in Baltimore docks, small and steady, steam
      ten knots, an' here's Cavarly an' Dan Morgan knowin' the coast better'n
      Webster's Primer consid'able. Let the Gove'nment commission her, an'
      Cavarly an' Dan'll raise the crew an' run her for high an' mighty? An'
      there you are, sir.' An' there he was, that ol' gen'lman 'ith the palm
      leaf beard, calm as a fish in his natchul element, an' me bustin' 'ith
      glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The Gove'nment doesn't commission privateers,' he says. 'Do I understand
      the parties offer this vessel to the Gove'nment? In that case&mdash;&mdash;'
      Then I saw of co'se it would have to be all regular, an' quite right he
      was though too much like ref'ige'ated fish, an' I inte'upted him. 'The
      parties wouldn' be satisfied unless Morgan an' I sailed her, bein' sort of
      in it ourselves&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In fact you are the parties,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, 'Not altogther. But it would be like this, sir. If we offer the
      <i>Octarara</i>, an' the Gove'nment puts her in commission, and furnishes
      equipments, arms, ammunition, mess, the parties might see it was only
      right the Gov'n-ment should put in its own crew, quite regular, especially
      gunners, sir. Sir,' I said, 'I reckon I can take the <i>Octarara</i> into
      the back dooryard of Virginia closer'n most, but put it you wanted to
      target practice on the back door&mdash;I'm no gunner myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah,' lie says, 'but you're not in the service now. That will of co'se be
      neces-sa'y. Well, sir, the Administ'ation appreciates your gen'osity,' he
      says. 'You'll convey the Administ'ation's thanks to these myste'ous
      parties,' he says, looking extraor'nary calm an' fishy. An' I goes back to
      Baltimore feelin' a trifle damp, but still pat'iotic. Well, sir, they're
      prompt at that Department, if they are damp. In three days I got orders to
      take the <i>Octarara</i> up here to be fitted out an' commissioned an'
      manned, an' instead of a family party there won't be but four Baltimore
      men aboard her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn't have anything that looked like privateering,&rdquo; said my
      father, after a pause, &ldquo;with a lot of Confederate privateers locked up in
      the Tombs here for piracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha's what I said to Dan. 'Twasn't reason to be sure. Dan wanted the
      family party; but he saw reason, an' brought the <i>Octarara</i> up, an' I
      came later, an' here we are, bustin' 'ith pat'iot-ism and ordered to
      Hampton Roads, maybe they know when. I don't myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Morgan. &ldquo;They do say huntin' blockade is like a
      dog after fleas, respectin' their liveliness, ve'y similar; him not
      knowin' where they are till he's bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Cavarly seemed to disapprove of this saying, glancing sharply at
      Mr. Morgan, whether because he felt it a slur on the navy, or for another
      reason, I could not guess at that time; moreover, they all now fell to
      looking at me inquiringly, which made me nervous and out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to refer you to the p'oper official, Mr. Cree,&rdquo; said Cavarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben, boy,&rdquo; said my father, in a voice quickly growing husky, while his
      eyes looked dim and sad, &ldquo;your uncle advises you ship naval apprentice,
      and he thinks you're as well not aboard the <i>Saratoga</i> as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's quite right, sir,&rdquo; said Cavarly. &ldquo;There was no favo'itism where I
      learned seamanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man can't throw the necessa'y belayin' pins at his relative,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Morgan. &ldquo;It lace'ates the feelin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Captain Cavarly is good enough to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tha's all right, tha's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll see if he can't get you a berth with him, if you like, Ben,
      supposing you feel that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father paused, looking troubled and uncertain, while Cavarly murmured,
      &ldquo;Tha's all right,&rdquo; soothingly, and Morgan, &ldquo;Don' lace'ate the feelin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For me, I felt bewildered, and my heart seemed to be pumping my head full
      of confusion, so that I stammered, saying I would go. Then Cavarly and
      Morgan and my father went on talking, while Calhoun sat quietly listening,
      and I was content enough to have no further notice taken of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that I went with my father and Captain Cavarly that
      afternoon, and climbed to a little upstairs office, where an orderly stood
      within the door; and there I was examined and entered a naval apprentice,
      with the privilege of full seamanship in a year, all the while in that
      state of excitement I would not have known the difference if they had
      listed me a porpoise with the privilege of becoming a whale.
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterwards we went by ferry to the navy yard, and saw the <i>Octarara</i>
      lying in dock, two-masted, side-wheeled, as steaming vessels mostly were
      in those days; neat though small; it might be less than two hundred tons,
      but a wonder in my eyes and very threatening to the Southern Confederacy.
      There seemed to be little doing on the <i>Octarara</i>, though the yard
      was full of noise and bustle. We found Morgan playing a banjo in the cabin
      and singing:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;This world is full o' trouble an' sin;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Don' keep me mournin' here, 0 Lord!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Don' keep me mournin' long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, Mr. Cree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The cap'en, he's troubled because we ain'
      goin' to be fit in time to crush the Southern Confede'acy. It's the sins
      an' sorrows o' this world troubles me. 'Don' keep me mournin' long.' Your
      son, sir, hasn't the liver complaint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, seeing Cavarly looking at him uneasily, he fell to playing his banjo
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's trouble, which Morgan spoke of, lest the <i>Octarara</i>
      should not be fit in time to crush the Confederacy, seemed to me more and
      more natural. For the weeks went by, and the yard all the time rushed with
      work, and it seemed a slight on the <i>Octarara</i>, that wonderful craft,
      that they passed her by in the way of preparation. December slipped away.
      On Christmas Day my father had the captains, Morgan and Calhoun, up to a
      handsome dinner, where there was great exchange of cordiality, and much
      grumbling at the delay, with great comfort taken out of the grumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was notable how gladly we listened to Calhoun. The captain particularly
      seemed to ponder on what he said, and turn it over in his mind, as if
      looking for a secret meaning. The great variety of Calhoun's information
      was odd in one not very old in years, and especially his knowledge of
      foreign lands and seas, trade lines and ocean navigation at large, whereas
      I gathered that Cavarly had never been beyond coasting trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun in his talk let himself be easily led to speak of the South
      Atlantic, and what amount of American shipping was found there. And all
      through it ran the stream of his personal adventure, from which I thought,
      even so early in my knowledge of him, that seldom was so foolhardy a man,
      to walk into any danger or adventure, wherever he could find it, and walk
      out again when ready to do so. Indeed, I think this of Calhoun, and may
      say so now, that he was never so pleased and satisfied, as when edging
      along in some peculiar and perilous circumstance, and that he would go far
      out of his way to find that circumstance. It is a secret hid in the nature
      of many that they love nothing better than the chance to fight skilfully
      for their own lives, and seek this chance by jungles, glaciers, and high
      seas. But I never knew one who sought it more inquisitively than Calhoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January Cavarly went away, and was gone, it might be, a week, but
      whether to Washington or Baltimore he did not say. Morgan said he was
      &ldquo;after a list of Southern cities desirable to bombard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was the 17th of February when we stood out into the river at last.
      My father was among a crowd of people cheering on the dock in the Wall
      about Canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was blowing bitter and cold, and cakes of ice were floating about
      us, as we slid into the bay after a tug that made a great swash and tumult
      in front. But the sky was as clear as if it were the first and newest of
      all days.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;DOWN THE COAST&mdash;CAVARLY'S PLAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <i>Octarara</i>
      might have ranked as a gunboat or a second-class cruiser, and it might be
      the Government did not rank her very high, for the only regular military
      aboard were three gunners and Simpson, chief gunner. Cavarly made Simpson
      master-at-arms, and set him drilling the crew, and left him mostly alone
      at it. Himself and Morgan, who ranked as mate, seemed to take no part in
      it, but to look on in a pleased kind of way, and find it quite amusing.
      They sailed the ship, with the other two Baltimore men, Gerry and Still,
      steersmen, and the engineers and stokers did nothing but oil cranks and
      polish brass. For Cavarly appeared to be in no hurry, nor anxious to use
      up coal, and nobody minded that, except Simpson. I did not like Simpson.
      Neither did Simpson like the <i>Octarara</i>, nor anything about her, and
      this with his falling foul of me immediately made me think him a person
      impossible to please.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n Cavarly,&rdquo; said Simpson, &ldquo;beg-gin' your pardon, does that there boy
      belong fore or aft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he belongs to you,&rdquo; said Cavarly cheerfully. &ldquo;Discipline. Tha's
      it. Discipline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git for'ard, you young pup!&rdquo; cried Simpson, &ldquo;ef you'll 'low me, cap'n.
      Pick up them lanyards. You hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; said Cavarly softly, and, looking back with furtive eyes from
      a safe distance, I saw Dan Morgan also and Calhoun by the taffrail
      laughing, and I thought it treacherous and unfriendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next four days and nights I was hating Simpson busily, and wishing the
      deep sea between him and me. We were ever and again up to &ldquo;repel
      boarders.&rdquo; and nothing in sight but the blank sea, or maybe a glimpse of
      the low peaceful Jersey coast. Seeing me idle or in any way happy put
      Simpson in a mad rage; but I could wish that gruff warrant officer no
      worse ill luck than such a raw and mixed crew as ours to put in shape,
      with a captain and mate appearing to regard him as a joke and taking no
      responsibility themselves. What could be more distressful to such a man
      than to have for superior officers Dan Morgan, playing his banjo half the
      day; Cavarly, looking on with an everlasting cigar, and a mysterious
      gentleman supercargo like Calhoun?
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was clean and steady, and Cavarly kept the <i>Octarara</i> close
      reefed, at half her speed; she crept down the coast with little shift of
      sail day or night, and on the 20th passed some fifteen miles to seaward of
      Delaware Bay. Except for Simpson drilling and roughing, it was an idle
      enough crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not so ignorant of sailing&mdash;what with knocking about wharves
      and handling catboats on the river&mdash;as not to know that Cavarly was
      purposely taking his time; and if I had been, the talk in the forecastle
      would have set me thinking, though for that matter. I did not know that
      the forecastle always criticizes the cabin, as one of the rights of
      labour. I did not think much of Simpson's opinion, through simple dislike,
      beginning things with such general misjudgment of men as maybe is the case
      with most; but Simpson was not alone in thinking the conduct of the cabin
      peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the morning drill exercise on the 20th there were more black-clay
      pipes going around the small safety stove in the forecastle than could be
      counted in the smoke. A dingy place, the forecastle, at best, but one that
      a man may grow to like well enough, if not over-squeamish. Simpson was
      there, and Gerry, and the bos'en, Hames, and an Irishman named Tobin,
      whose hair was red and thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will we get there, do ye think, Jimmie Hames?&rdquo; said Tobin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, beyant. Will it be while we're still young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't that we won't git there,&rdquo; said Hames slowly. &ldquo;It's why the ol'
      man don't want to git there soon as he kin. He don't, an' that's straight.
      Here's Gerry now, that comed with him from Baltimore. I asks him now, why
      don't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerry puffed deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I come f'om Baltimore. I don't deny it, do I? But
      if you asks, why don't he? I says, I reckon he has sec'et orders. But, I
      says, he never showed 'em to me. An',&rdquo; he went on with ponderous scorn,
      &ldquo;the Sec'etary o' the Navy come f'om Connecticut, same as you. Wha'd he
      tell you them see'et orders was, when you took dinner with him an' was
      int'oduced to three rear admirals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders!&rdquo; growled Simpson. &ldquo;That's all right. He can hitch his hawser to a
      porpoise, if he's ordered. What's my business? That ain't. But what does
      the Government do next? Why they commissions the porpoise. <i>Course</i>,
      they do. It's politics. Makes volunteer naval officers as don't know a
      shell from a round shot till it busts in their ear. An' that ain't my
      business either. Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, gunner, easy,&rdquo; said Gerry, who was a slow, heavy man. &ldquo;I don't know
      see'et orders natchully, but I hears talk. I hears like this. I hears this
      boat's offered the Gove'nment by parties for a birthday present, supposin'
      Cavarly's cap'n an' the Gove'nment fits her out. An' the Gove'nment says,
      'Hum.' says he, 'is he competent?' 'None better,' says they, 'for coast
      sailin'. 'An' there's Dan Morgan,' says they, 'sailed the Delaware an'
      southe'n tidewater these twenty years.' 'But,' says the Gove'nment, 'there
      might be a disagreement with the enemy,' says he, speakin' sa'castic.
      'There you have us,' says the parties. 'Give him a master-at-arms an'
      gunners.' 'Ah!' says the Gove'nment. 'Jus' so. Take Simpson,' says he, an'
      cuts a caper, bein' that pleased. Now I asks, what's t'oublin' you? Ain't
      you competent? Ain't the cap'n standin' off an' givin' you free board?
      Ain't you as good as a commissioned officer, barrin' fo'c'stle bunk?
      What's t'oublin' you? That's what I asks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simpson grumbled, but in a mollified way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't sayin' he can't handle the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n Cavarly,&rdquo; said Hames, &ldquo;is a good man I make no doubts, an' comin'
      from Maryland his principles is a credit to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartain, sartain,&rdquo; said Hames, soothingly, &ldquo;an' your principles is a
      credit to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad o' that,&rdquo; said Gerry in his heavy manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Hames went on, &ldquo;who's this here Calhoun? Tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the point. A chap in gen'le-man's shore clothes, occupies a cabin
      an' no words. Goes snoopin' round like he owned the airth. Looks like a
      summer boarder. That's what I don't like. The cap'n an' the mate, they's
      pleasant chaps. I ain't down on 'em. But they're keerless, ain't they?
      Playin' banjos an' smokin' seegars. They ain't suspicious. 'Taint their
      natur'. Fellow comes along, seegars in both pockets, playin' the banjo
      with his elbow. Maybe he says he wants to write a book for the glory of
      his ken-try. Maybe he lies. Acts friendly anyhow. Cap'n asks him to jine
      'em, bein' keerless an' happy, thinkin' it might be a good thing for the
      glory of his kentry. How do we know, you an' me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; murmured Gerry. &ldquo;Cap'n's business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calhoun!&rdquo; said Simpson angrily. He'd better not come Calhounin' round
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that day I could think of nothing but Calhoun, and how he must be a
      slippery villain, such as novels and plays describe very plainly, and
      always destroy in the end to everyone's satisfaction. So I went on to
      imagining Ben Cree standing by to distinguish himself, as a fellow of his
      age should, according to the story books, where there is apt to be such a
      one, remarkably young, with his pockets full of virtue and talent, and
      missing his destiny unless he can find a rascal to surprise with his
      virtue and talent. The only trouble was that Ben Cree was a numskull. I
      had gotten so far in the plot as to see without doubt that Calhoun was a
      disguised Confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Octarara</i> passed Cape Henlopen about noon, and drew in to the
      low, sandy shore. By and by Gerry showed me where the Maryland dividing
      line came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great moon rose&mdash;out of the sea it seemed to rise&mdash;and it
      was as if a path of bright metals were laid for it, supposing it wished to
      step down to the <i>Octarara</i> with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air on deck was cold, but not bitterly so, the wind lessening, and the
      topsails and jibs spread full. A man or two was on the fore-deck, looking
      landward. I heard Tobin saying, &ldquo;What's he drawin' in for, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Dan Morgan aft called for Simpson.
    </p>
    <p>
      More men came on deck. Simpson went aft and returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' to come to,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Says he's expectin' orders. Durn likely
      he'll get 'em next month. What's my business? That ain't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simpson went below growling in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sec'et orders,&rdquo; said Gerry soothingly, and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not until late, and the moon high in the air, that the anchor
      was dropped, with great bustle, in the midst of that strange quiet and
      brilliance of the night. The shore could be made out now dimly under the
      moon, and the soft moan of beach waves be heard, so near it was. Looking
      aft as we went below I could see the cabin lights all lit and shining up
      the companionway. Gerry and Still stayed up on watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay long awake in my narrow bunk, not able to sleep for foolishness, and
      acting out the plots of three or four mixed stories. One snore was added
      to another till the whole was a rumble like the bass of an organ. The
      smoky lantern hanging near the scuttle hardly swayed, for the sea was very
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long time, it might have been an hour, I sat up and wondered if I
      dared go on deck. It took me some time to decide, what with imagining
      Simpson waking up and coming at me roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even getting on a pea jacket seemed an adventure, but done at last. I
      crept to the hatchway, shoes in hand and dreading Simpson, and so up and
      lifted the hatch. I wanted to get across behind the ship's boat on the
      port side, and look my fill at the shining water and the low-lying
      mysterious shore; and this I succeeded in doing. I heard steps coming
      forward along the main deck, and, peering over the top of the boat, seemed
      to make out it was Gerry, a good-natured man, but certainly one who would
      send me below where I belonged. I lifted a loose edge of the canvas that
      covered the boat, and crawled in, half frightened and half pleased with
      the excitement and conceit of the stratagem; much as in earlier days I
      used to hide behind boxes on the wharf, when Mr. Hooley went by with his
      buttons and club, and suppose myself a criminal and Mr. Hooley looking for
      me, that large, friendly officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising the loose edge of canvas I could see the full sweep of the deck,
      and sideways over the rail the moonlit water and shore. I could not see
      Gerry, but heard him stop by the hatch. There he seemed to stand quietly.
      I rubbed my fingers to warm them. It was not uncomfortable under the thick
      canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the quarter deck in the bright light of the companion way was Still, as
      if on guard like Gerry by the fore hatch, and by the rail, looking
      shorewards, were Cavarly and Morgan. Calhoun was not to be seen. Cavarly
      held a red lantern, and moved it once up and down, once to and fro, and
      stopped. Again up and down, to and fro, and stopped. I rubbed my fingers,
      and my scalp prickled. I wondered what he would be doing with a red
      lantern, like a switch tender; then I thought of Gerry and the &ldquo;sec'et
      orders.&rdquo; Presently there would come out a boat to be sure. What could Ben
      Cree ask better? and Mr. Hooley right beyond question that water thieving
      was low.
    </p>
    <p>
      I peered from under the edge of canvas shorewards. A red light was there
      but a moment, and disappeared, whether on shore or in a boat, I could not
      tell. And so peering and straining, my eyes became blurred with the
      darkness and the glitter together, so that red lights and cloudy shapes
      seemed to be everywhere, and I had to rub them to be sure it was no ghost
      of a three-master, instead of a heavily oared boat coming aboard us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was coming, now plainly in sight, bringing the &ldquo;sec'et orders.&rdquo;
       Secret orders! Boat! Three boats there were, loaded to the water's edge
      with men.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came one behind the other, noiselessly, without clatter or clang of
      oarlock, or drip of blade, low in the water, dim in the moonlight, three
      masses of black heads and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oarlocks and blades were wrapped in cloths for muffling, making the
      rowing stiff but without noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Cree was a scared one in a moment, and resembled no hero of his
      recollection, crouching in the ship's boat, bewildered, and not in the
      least wishing to jump out and demand the surrender of anything in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were wonderfully quiet. I could not hear a whisper, only the tap-tap
      of feet, as they came forward one by one and took stations about the
      hatch. Then I heard Cavarly speaking, first softly, then sharp and loud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone cover his man, and stand for orders. Down with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went down with a roar, and so much confused noise rose up immediately
      that I made out but one separate sound, the sharp crack of a single
      pistol. It was quiet a moment, and then only Cavarly's voice giving
      commands. I lifted the edge of the canvas once more. The main deck was
      empty, except for one man at the gangway. On the quarter deck Calhoun was
      standing in the light of the companion. He walked forward and spoke to the
      man at the gangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stream of men were coming up the fore hatch now, marching aft, two by
      two, at intervals of twenty feet, and passing quite near me. Simpson went
      first, his mouth working terribly with shame and anger. The rear man of
      each couple held a level pistol, and the moonlight shone on the barrel.
      Calhoun came along by them, sat on the end of the ship's boat over me and
      fell to whistling softly. Jimmie Hames passed, limping and half carried.
      He swore at Calhoun, who stopped whistling a moment and took it up again.
      Each man sent his prisoner down the gangway, and fell into line with his
      pistol lifted and ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly came forward, when that was settled, and sat on the edge of the
      ship's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;this here's a Confede'ate privateer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I suppose. Very clever, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold letters of marque, quite regular, from Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you suppose. Jus' so. Will you have a cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Followed the sharp scratching of a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't call yourself a citizen of anything in particular, hey? You've
      sailed the South Atlantic conside'able. I haven't myself. Tha's my point.
      But lookin' at it as a commercial speculation&mdash;tha's your point&mdash;why,
      I can offer you the regular qua'ter deck commissions, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a commercial speculation,&rdquo; said Calhoun, &ldquo;it's no good. You get
      prizes, but what then? You can't sell them. Your ports are blocked. That's
      neither your point nor mine, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;then, wha's your point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it you're out fighting according to your opinions. That's your
      point. As for me, I see two of my own. First, you've laid out a fair sized
      circus for this cruise. I like circuses. I'd rather do a tight rope than
      eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jus' so,&rdquo; said Cavarly doubtfully. &ldquo;Tha's right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second point, this crew, that's leaving us unkindly, is ready to swear me
      up for treason to a man. They think I'm the snake in the grass. Gerry told
      you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did! He did that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, if you ask me, do I swear everlasting something or other, I
      say, no. But if it comes to go or stay, I stay, supposing I have the
      choice. Those are my points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't ve'y cordial, tha's a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of points, however, is it good enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Good enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the two men rose and walked aft. The three boats got off quickly.
      Simpson, I think it was, stood up in the stem of the last, and yelled
      something hoarse and shrieking. They slid away in the moonlight, grew dim
      and dimmer. If anyone should ask why I did not show myself and go ashore
      where I belonged, there is no answer in me. It might have been the
      foolishness that came natural to me, or that, being too astonished to do
      anything, I did nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I did was nearly as odd. The engines fell to groaning and
      pumping below monotonously, as their steam came to a head, and in time all
      bustle near me had ceased. And, being healthy and tired, lying not
      uncomfortably, I fell fast asleep under the close canvas of the ship's
      boat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;I TALK WITH CALHOUN AND THE &ldquo;OCTARARA&rdquo; GOES EAST AND
      WEST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> ship's boat has a
      flat board running the lengthway and well enough to sleep on, but from
      beneath go out ribs which are prominent and sharp. I awoke with someone
      jerking and tipping, making my dreams uncomfortable; and before any waking
      thought had come he had banged my head on a rib of the boat, so that I
      yelled aloud, and thought presently I would get up, and there would be a
      fight. But there was none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dragging and tipping of the boat stopped, someone lifted the canvas
      and pulled me out by the collar. I stood on the fore deck, blinking in the
      broad sunlight foolishly, and around me were a group of strange faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;What is it? Take it aft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two men shoved me along before them, till we came down into the cabin, and
      there were Cavarly, Morgan, and Calhoun taking breakfast cheerfully.
      Surprised they were to see me, and Cavarly not pleased, but Morgan began
      to laugh wonderfully, and said I would be the death of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words, you sinful young oyster. If you don't die first o' the
      liver complaint, you'll be the death o' me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly asked how I came to stay aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you hadn't crossed my mind these twenty-four hours, tha's
      a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not like his pointing out that way how unimportant I was, and I
      asked boldly where we were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Due east now,&rdquo; said Cavarly gently. &ldquo;Why, sonny, we're goin' to dest'oy
      commerce down the South Atlantic. You ain't any business here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're goin' to attack the flag o' your country,&rdquo; said Morgan, leaning
      forward and wrinkling his mouth. I grew very hot in the face and shouted
      angrily, &ldquo;I'm not, either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. You're goin' to perfo'm prodigies o' valour an' implant a tin sword
      in the chest o' your uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. You'll come home cove'd with glory an' gore, an' a full-rigged ship
      in each pocket, an' be hung at the Fede'al Gove'nment's expense, the rest
      o' your relatives attendin' the ce'emony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain and Calhoun and the two men were laughing loudly, and, not
      being able to stay angry to any purpose, I said nothing, and presently
      felt more calm, but I thought I would not mind being the death of Dan
      Morgan. He drew more amusement from me, and my attacking the flag of the
      country, than seemed right.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a boy with a green jacket in the school on Willet Street once
      who made it plain that he was for States' Rights. I think he did not know
      what they were. And we tied a rope around him and his green jacket, and
      took off the well-top in the yard, and let him down, so that he came up
      very wet, we were that interested in the subject, and most of us Whigs or
      Free Soilers, without knowing what these meant either. You do not have to
      know what politics mean, or patriotism, or any brave words, in order to
      feel strongly about them. But if anyone in Willet Street had hinted
      himself able to attack the flag of his country, it would have been bad for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly looked troubled, and rubbed his forehead with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Ben. I don' like this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him cabin boy,&rdquo; said Calhoun. &ldquo;Land him with the first crew we
      capture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. I wouldn't like to play it low on the landlord. He's a white
      man, your father, Ben, hey? He ain't ve'y penet'ative, sort o' simple. But
      he's hones'. My! he's hones'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I became cabin boy on the <i>Nameless</i>, as they called the <i>Octarara</i>
      now, having smeared out the beautifully painted name over the anchor
      holes; and I was set to very common jobs, to sweep, to clean, and fetch
      and carry gentlemen's meals, quite melancholy at first and disgusted with
      my luck. I was possessed of a sense of being loose and anchorless in the
      world. I could not feel my bearings after so great a revolution. As if the
      sky and the sea were to change places, it might be questionable in a man's
      mind whether it were proper to walk on his hands or his feet. Or, if he
      enters a strange city with his north and south wrong, he will not easily
      make friends with the compass in that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet they all seemed inclined to make it up to me with good-nature. Gerry
      and Still would teach me steering, how to hold the wheel so that the
      needle did not waver; to feel the good ship answer the shove of my hand
      made me feel as important as the north wind. Calhoun would call me to come
      where he sat in the lee of the cabin and talk with him, and while we
      talked he would watch me narrowly. Cavarly seemed to have me on his mind
      to trouble him, for he had taken a liking to my father&mdash;&ldquo;Not
      pene-t'ative, he ain't, Ben, but he's hones'.&rdquo; And Dan Morgan would bring
      his banjo evenings by the cabin windows, and there bellow at the moon like
      a sick calf:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;This world is full o' trouble an' sin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Don' keep me mournin' long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not see why a fellow with red cheeks like mine should move him
      so to speak of the liver complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly was sparing coal no longer. The <i>Nameless</i> cut her way
      eastward, her black snake of smoke streaming off behind. And, though the
      wind was cold and bit the skin of one's face till it felt like sharp
      medicine in the mouth, yet the sky continued clear. I liked to watch the
      foam of the wake, its infinite bubbling, and the swarthy, rumpled sea,
      stretching away all about till the sky came down to it gracefully and both
      were clamped together on the horizon. So that during those days, 22d, 23d,
      and 24th, if I have counted right, I cannot say that I was in great
      despair, though plainly making a false start and not in any way to fame
      and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly's idea was to go east a bit, and then turn sharply south, to fall
      in the track of commerce between the Northern cities and South America,
      Cape Horn, and the Indian Ocean, in this manner to escape the pursuit he
      expected would follow him, and pick up prizes in seas where there was
      little likelihood of interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 25th of February broke with a great white mist everywhere, clinging to
      the sea in a feathery, sticky way. The ship had turned, and was going due
      south, not at full speed any longer, but quite leisurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun called me where he sat against the rail that morning, tipping his
      chair and smoking, and then fell to asking how I liked things, and how I
      would get home from foreign parts. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, if I were you, I shouldn't care for South America. Seems
      to me I'd prefer the United States most anywhere. But you haven't the
      choice, have you? That's a pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't,&rdquo; I said gloomily, and did not thank him for putting in me
      troubles and wishes that were of no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deck now was empty, except for Still at the wheel some distance away.
      Cavarly was forward, and Morgan somewhere below. Calhoun went on in a
      quiet, even tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a pity. But a man can't tell, you know, till he's thought it over,
      can he? Why, I heard once of a fellow that wanted to go to San Francisco
      in a ship that was bound from Honolulu round the Horn. That didn't seem
      good judgment. And yet he went to 'Frisco all right. How? Well, it was
      this way. He sort of thought it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smoked thoughtfully a moment, then put his hand in his pocket, took out
      a piece of iron three inches long, and looked at it as if it had been his
      watch, lying in the palm of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sort of thought it over. 'Now,' he says, 'here's the fact: a ship
      always sails by the needle in the compass. The way she depends on that
      measly little thing is pathetic. If she wants to go south, she goes
      opposite the needle. If she wants to go east or west or anyhow, she goes
      at proper angles with that needle. It's singular, it's pathetic, but it's
      true,' says the fellow I'm telling you of. 'Now,' he says, 'this ship
      wants to go south, and she sails against the needle. Now, it stands to
      reason, if I point that piece of ironmongery west, this ship'll sail east,
      and that's 'Frisco. Don't it?' he says. 'Why not?' Well, sir, he went over
      that again, and maybe three or four times, and the more he thought it over
      the more it appeared to be correct. And what did he do? Did he stick a pin
      into the little thing? Not he. He persuaded it. He argued with it
      according to its nature. He thought the best way to treat things was
      according to their nature. He took a magnet, which is a piece of iron&mdash;um&mdash;something
      like this one&mdash;it happened to look like this one. A magnet is a piece
      of iron, as you might say, with a ghost in it, something sticky in its
      vitals. He got a chance to hold the wheel by himself. He put that magnet
      into the binnacle on the little shelf under the compass, on the right side
      of the needle, just half-way round the circle. Course, if he'd wanted to
      go west instead of east, say, such a direction as from here to the United
      States, he'd have put it on the left side corresponding. Well, sir, that
      magnet, such was the stickiness of its vitals, it pulled the business end
      of the needle around plumb over it, and there it stayed. Then this fellow
      I'm telling you of, he put the ship about, taking caution not to disturb
      anyone, taking great caution, because he thought it wouldn't be right to
      disturb anyone, and pointed her for 'Frisco. And that needle kept on
      telling a yarn that would have made a keg of nails blush. Yes, sir, it
      lied steady for twenty-four days without turning a hair&mdash;wet weather
      it was, or misty, like this&mdash;till they brought up on the coast of
      California, and the fellow I'm telling you of, well, he sloped. Course, if
      a ship's going south, and a man can't help himself, he can't. But this
      fellow sort of thought it over, and it seemed to him, the needle being a
      good liar and the sun not coming out to mess things, that there wasn't any
      real need of his going to the Horn. That was his opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later I was standing alone by the rail and staring blankly after
      Calhoun, where he strolled slowly forward and grew dim in the mist. The
      little piece of black iron had got into my hand. It was no more than three
      inches long and sharp at the corners. The only sounds about the misty ship
      were the slow shoving of the engines below, and Still at the wheel
      whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered at Calhoun, that singular man, and wondered at this business
      altogether which I was in. For Cavarly and Morgan had played their great
      trick, and here was Calhoun tricking them, and how should I know what he
      might be doing with me, he a man so full of stratagem. I thought there
      would be no way of telling that, and I had better play the part that
      seemed to be laid out for me; but I felt very lonely and troubled, and not
      cheerful, not as I used to in setting off fire crackers behind Mr. Hooley,
      though that was considered perilous enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to Still, thinking to fall into talk with him indifferently, but
      my throat was gaspy and choked in an odd way. Still's pipe was out, and he
      wanted me to go forward and fetch him his plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said, with my knees shaking disgracefully, &ldquo;you go, and let me
      hold the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, Bennie, hardly. An' you learnin' seaman's duty o' me that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some footsteps were coming along the deck, and I thought the chance was
      gone; but it was Calhoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can steer good. Honest, Still. You see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind that,&rdquo; said Still apologetically to Calhoun, &ldquo;but 'twouldn't
      be right to leave him alone, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay here,&rdquo; said Calhoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ve'y good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried away. Calhoun sat down, with his back to me and his feet braced
      on the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all there was nothing difficult about it. I slipped the little black
      iron to its place, in the binnacle, to the left of the compass. It went in
      too far, so that the needle swung to east by south, and I had to pull the
      iron back. The needle lay trembling at right angles with the ship, and I
      began to turn the wheel nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow I was telling you of,&rdquo; remarked Calhoun without looking
      around, &ldquo;he took his time, so as not to disturb anyone. He didn't fidget.
      He kept his eye on the compass, counted eight points, and turned the wheel
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ship swung softly and steadily; the needle crept from point to point,
      till the quarter was covered. Still came along the deck, looming in the
      mist and puffing his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold her steady, Bennie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Seaman's duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there was nothing in the white sea-fog to betray; Calhoun's back was
      as non-committal as the fog; the little black iron with its ghost inside
      it lay on the shelf in the binnacle silently too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ship, slipping along through the fog so quietly, with so much
      misunderstanding aboard her, seemed to me something uncanny. I felt as if
      we were under a spell, and afterwards as if all the seamen looked at me
      oddly, wondering that so chubby-cheeked a boy should dare interfere with a
      ship's compass; and, when Morgan would call me &ldquo;a sinful oyster who would
      be the death of him,&rdquo; I longed to tell him what a mixed man he was, with
      no cause to joke at all. Sometimes Cavarly's remorse at having to drop me
      at some distant port would give me a twist of conscience in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day&mdash;that would be the 28th&mdash;the fog turned to a
      soaking rain, and after that the wind rose in the northwest, which Cavarly
      took for southwest. On the 1st of March we crossed a steamer going east&mdash;or
      north, as Cavarly thought. It looked like a passenger steamer. He thought
      it could not be American in the waters where he supposed himself, and
      going in that direction, and so let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the 2d broke with the gale still blowing but the rain had
      ceased. A large, double-funnelled something was coming down our wake, a
      dusky spot in the gray half-daylight far away, with two towers of black
      smoke over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was trouble on the <i>Nameless</i> when the stranger was made out by
      the growing light to be a cruiser, nearly large enough to carry the
      Nameless for a long boat, and with the starred and striped flag floating
      overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an odd thing about that flag, when you meet it on the high seas
      and the wind is blowing hard&mdash;namely, that of all flags I know it is
      the most alive, when the wind blows, the most eager and keen, with the
      stripes flowing and darting like snakes, and the stars seeming to dance
      with the joy of excitement. So that there is none better to go into
      battle, or come down the street when the fifes are piping ahead; but if
      you want something to signify peace and quiet, you would be as well off
      with not such bristling stars and fewer stripes, for the stars will leap
      and the stripes show their energy wherever the wind blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nameless did not alter her course, but got up steam and plunged on
      with great thumping and thunder of engines. The cruiser seemed hardly to
      be gaining. I noticed Calhoun on the roof of the cabin looking forward,
      and wondered if we were near land. I think Calhoun must have somehow kept
      the bearings and known where we were, for the lookout cried &ldquo;Land!&rdquo; at
      near eleven o'clock. Cavarly took it for the Bermudas at first, but
      probably knowing the Bermudas to have a high, rocky coast, he came forward
      and scanned the shore a long time through his glass silently. It seemed to
      be a low-lying, sandy shore, with little growth, if any. Through a glass
      you could make out the great surf piling upon it, white and dangerous. I
      went on the roof of the cabin, and Calhoun told me softly those were the
      banks of the Carolinas, meaning that low belt, outlying along the coast, a
      breakwater of sand pressed up by the sea, with quiet waters commonly
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship turned to the quarter and headed south.
    </p>
    <p>
      By twelve another spot of black smoke rose on the edge of the sea, and
      this was from the south. In half an hour it was made out to be another
      cruiser, smaller, and floating the striped flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly walked the deck, gripping his hands, and his face seemed to grow
      gray and lined with the pain of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered the men to be called aft, and spoke, standing by the cabin
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sayin' what that shore is. I don' know, not me. We lost our
      bearings. It looks to me mighty cur'ous. But I'm sayin' there's no
      Yankee's goin' to capture my ship. <i>Nameless</i> she is, an' <i>Nameless</i>
      she goes. I'm goin' to beach her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone cried, &ldquo;Beach her, cap'n. We're in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, as it seemed to me, there was nothing but roar and tumult,
      with moments passing like seconds, till the cruise of the <i>Nameless</i>
      ended. I remember a shell from one of the cruisers that skipped along the
      water beside us&mdash;like those flat stones we used to throw slanting
      into the East River&mdash;and burst with a crack and spatter of spray just
      ahead. I remember how the surf towered and bubbled and roared at the
      ship's bows, and how I was cast headlong on the deck when she grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fired her too near the powder, and she blew up before the last had
      left, and one of the boats foundered in the surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember how bitterly the men worked, drawing the other boats over the
      sand hills, a quarter of a mile it might be, to the water within. The
      cruisers lay off shore, not daring to lower boats for the high seas and
      surf. But the strangest sight to me was the six drowned men, lying in the
      wash, and among them with his lips pursed out, as if amused and smiling up
      into the wild sky, that singular man, Dan Morgan. For he looked as if he
      liked it well enough, lying dead in the wash of the sea, and thought it
      odd at any rate that Bennie Cree should have been the death of him.

      where the ship lay rolling in the surf and burning sullenly. Cavarly went
      over the sand hills and saw it, and made out a forested shore across the
      water, and saw the sail of a fishing boat in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left Gerry and me to draw the bodies up the sand, and give them such
      poor graves as we could scoop with our hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark before the boats were brought to the inner beach. I heard
      Calhoun telling Cavarly there would be no landing from the cruisers till
      daybreak, and probably none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would they do it for? The ship's burned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' calculate till I know where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;suppose it's the Bahamas. They wouldn't then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bahamas! How come we to get to the Bahamas? Ho, they wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think he knew it was the United States, and no Bahamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were wet, shivering, and exhausted. The night was dark, the wind cold
      and of spray. Cavarly ordered us to scatter, and each find dry sand among
      the dunes, if he could, to cover himself with. What with the darkness and
      the shrieking wind, at twenty feet from your next neighbour you were quite
      alone, seeing and hearing nothing of him. Presently I was stumbling among
      sliding sand heaps; and after I had found a sheltered spot, I did not care
      where it was, but scraped off the wet top sand and, burying myself in the
      dry beneath, there lay shaking and gasping with the chill till I fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning broke with the grey, driving clouds still over us. We got
      away, without looking to see whether the cruisers on the other side were
      waiting or not, every man with sand on his hair and clothes, a silent and
      pale-faced company. Few had slept for the wet and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in the boat with Cavarly, and saw him gazing at the distant shore
      and wrinkling his brow and pulling his beard. A thin, sallow man it was,
      named Henry, who pulled the bow oar and kept his head turned over his
      shoulder. Presently he unshipped his oar, got up and looked ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;beggin' your pardon, that's Redwood, North Ca'lina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon like enough,&rdquo; growled Cavarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happen I was bo'n over there,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Drove the mules to a mule
      windlass, what they haul seines with, on that same beach. That's Tommy
      Todd's boathouse, an' he lives back o' them pitch pines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Cavarly, &ldquo;an' pull for Tommy Todd's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men gave a faint cheer and shouted to the boat behind. But Cavarly
      looked no more cheerful than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drew to the shore, where an old weather-beaten boathouse stood, the
      mule windlass before it, two uprights with a monstrous spool between; and
      we straggled wearily up the beach, seeing in the distance a long,
      shambling house among the pitch pines, with smoke rising from the chimney.
      There Henry beat upon the door, opened it to a sound within, and we
      streamed into a low, smoky room where a man and a woman sat at breakfast.
      A fat negro woman was frying bacon on a stove, and an old negro man sat
      bent over in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiop! Jemima!&rdquo; cried the man at the table. &ldquo;Four, six, eight! Hol' on!
      Too many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' you know me, Tommy Todd? I'm Pete Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you be. Jemima! You're sociable, Pete Henry. Ten, twelve! Been
      gettin' acquainted, ain't you! Fourteen, fifteen! Jemima!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly introduced himself and made Mr. Todd more calm, for he seemed an
      excitable man and sarcastic. He was square-set, but bony, and wore a thin,
      gray chin beard and a faded black coat with dangling tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Todd screeched when we first began to pour in, the fat negro woman
      jabbered wildly and crowded herself back of the stove, and the old negro
      man cried out in astonishment, &ldquo;An' mah name's Tuppentine!&rdquo; But presently
      we were seated about everywhere, and mainly on the floor, eating corn
      bread and bacon, which the fat cook fried for us, rolling her eyes as if
      it had come to her that we would ask for fried cook, when there was no
      more bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Druv in by the Yankees! Jemima!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him telling Cavarly, if he went down to Redwood early the next
      morning, there might be a steamer which would take him round through the
      Sound and up the Chowan River to a railroad at some place, and so from
      there to Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the men lay all about the house, and slept. I went out of doors
      and found the sun shining. Cavarly, Gerry, and Still were standing near
      the door. They all turned and looked at me. Cavarly frowned suddenly, as
      if with a twinge of pain, and pulled his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down on the sand and by the boathouse found a warm, drowsy place in
      the sun and out of the breeze. Far across the water I could see the low
      yellow lines of the Banks. I lay there an hour or more, contented as an
      ox, or any healthy animal that has been through sore labour and afterwards
      been given a stomachful and bit of sun to lie in. Only I was stiff and
      sore. And it was sad, looking across the water, to think of Dan Morgan in
      his scooped grave, with the sands and the sea about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun came round the boathouse, and sat down near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're on to us,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started and felt as if struck with a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calmly, Bennie Ben. Cavarly's been talking with Still and keeping the
      corner of his eye on me till I'm nervous. It's pretty straight anyhow. He
      couldn't help coming to it. You didn't suppose the old man was foolish?
      Now, if he comes to you about it, you'd better give in. Lying isn't your
      style. You're not gifted that way, meaning no offense. You couldn't do it
      without looking as if you'd burgled a bank. If he comes to me, I don't
      know. It looks to me like a circus with a tight-rope dancing very neat. I
      don't see how you could better it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun smoothed his cheek thoughtfully, and seemed to be balancing the
      nice chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody's coming down, Bennie Ben. Hear 'em? Cavarly saw me. Thinks
      he'll take us together. If they don't say anything, we don't say anything.
      That's our point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slid down the sand about thirty feet, and lay in the sun, with his hat
      over his face. I did not know anything better to do than to seem asleep,
      and probably had my mouth shut tight and hands stiff, so that anyone could
      see through me if he chose to take the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps came round the corner and stopped beside me, then moved down
      the sand. In a moment I opened my eyes a crack. Cavarly was sitting on the
      sand near Calhoun, Gerry and Still standing behind him. Calhoun had just
      pushed his hat from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warm here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thinking,&rdquo; said Cavarly, &ldquo;we'll take that boat and go up to Richmond.
      But you an' Ben Cree there, I was thinkin' you're some dif'ent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Calhoun, looking surprised, &ldquo;don't you want us to go with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes! Not that at all. Glad to have you. But it might happen
      you'd have some idea&mdash;Course I don' know. But you ain't really bound&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued Calhoun, &ldquo;if you're thinking of sending Ben to his
      people, you'd better take him with you as far as you go. Maybe you could
      see him through to Baltimore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! that's so,&rdquo; said Cavarly cheerfully. &ldquo;An' wha's your point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine! Well, you see my position. What would you advise, as a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cavarly hesitated and spoke stiffly, with embarrassment. &ldquo;I don' know as
      I'm up to that. Appears most natural to go to Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. And what point would there be in not staying by you. We go to&mdash;what
      you call it&mdash;Redwood, to-morrow? Early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat up as the three men passed, but they hardly looked at me, and said
      nothing. Calhoun kept his hat over his face till their footsteps died
      away, then turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain didn't argue that well,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;He ought to be dead sure,
      and he isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he might feel sure of it when we got to Richmond, and
      then he'd arrest us, wouldn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richmond! We're not going to Richmond. We're going to light out of here
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought Calhoun was difficult to follow in his plans, and waited for
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, see here, Bennie Ben!&rdquo; he said indignantly. &ldquo;Here's the old man
      going round looking like a suppressed wildcat and thinking I'm not on to
      him! That's absurd. It don't give me any credit. He ought to be sure we
      fiddled with his compass, and he ought to know I'm on to him. Must be he's
      busted with his ship. Why, he's a clever man, Bennie, but look how he's
      doing! Course, if a fellow is going to do another fellow, he has to make
      up his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;North. Follow the pole star. You lie by that pantry door to-night, Bennie
      Ben. I figure it out like <i>x</i> plus <i>y</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun settled his hat over his face and seemed to give himself genuinely
      to sleep. He said nothing more till we heard Mr. Todd shouting, &ldquo;Hiop!
      Dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the afternoon he fell to wandering about aimlessly. I did not dare
      follow him, so that I was more than half unhappy with tickling curiosity,
      and glad when night came, and I had no longer to carry about in daylight a
      secret that made me nervous. If Calhoun had heard me on the point of
      telling Cavarly that I hoped to see him again another time, he would not
      have thought himself so infallible a plotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Todd had learned from the men how I first fell among them&mdash;a
      thin woman and not very talkative. She brought me another blanket, where I
      lay by the pantry door, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don't ye mind, don't ye mind;&rdquo; which set me to swallowing lumps in
      my throat suddenly. It had not occurred to me those many days to be
      homesick, and it was a poor time to begin. She touched my hair with dry,
      bony fingers, and I remembered having seen a queer black and white drawing
      over the mantelpiece in the next room, of a medium-sized boy in a short
      jacket. It could not have been a good drawing, for he looked very
      flattened out. I sat up quickly to stop the homesickness, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he your son, in the drawing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's dead,&rdquo; she answered gruffly, and then in a moment repeated quite
      softly: &ldquo;Don't ye mind, don't ye mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By and by the great kitchen, or living room, was full of men, snoring and
      wheezing in the dark. Before the lamp was put out I saw Calhoun in a
      rocking-chair, with his feet under the stove. I lay still, and looked at
      the two windows which glimmered with the dim moonlight outdoors, and that
      waiting seemed to be something endless and ghostly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not hear Calhoun till he lay beside me, nor did I hear him open the
      pantry door, so softly and slowly he moved. But we went through the door,
      and closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight shone in the pantry window. I remember taking things from a
      tin pan and putting them in my pockets. They were a sort of sweet, crusty
      biscuit. Calhoun put a piece of silver where were no more biscuits, and we
      slid through the window, and crept along in the shadow of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiop!&rdquo; said someone close by and softly, through the crack of a window
      next the pantry. &ldquo;Hol' on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stopped short.. The window went up slowly, and Mr. Todd leaned out in
      his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you goin' th'ough my window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to cut and run,&rdquo; said Calhoun despondently, &ldquo;if you don't object.
      If you do, we yield the point. You needn't make a row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha' for you goin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain's down on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jemima! But I bet you chaps is Yanks, both of ye. Tell ye how I guess it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Todd appeared as a white outline further back in the room, and said
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said Mr. Todd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em alone,&rdquo; she whispered angrily. &ldquo;Hey? Wha' for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let 'em alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, grumbling and hesitating, &ldquo;I don' know as there's
      anythin' in it for me. Hol' on now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled him back and closed the window softly, and so we came away from
      the house of Tommy Todd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cold, with a thin slip of moon shivering over the sea. We struck to
      the rear of the house, through a great pine wood, where the trunks had
      been scraped for turpentine, and looked like rows of tombstones filing to
      right and left; and at the end of a mile we fell upon a fair travelled
      highway, leading a little westward of the pole star.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that night it was nothing but putting one foot before another, hour
      after hour, at first eagerly, and at the end only with the dull intent to
      keep it up till sunrise. At sunrise we passed over a black creek, through
      a bit of cypress swamp, and into a great pine wood on either side of the
      road. And here we left the road for a secret, sunny spot to sleep in,
      finding it well enough, for the wood was full of open spaces, and bottomed
      over with ridges and hollows of sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were too leg-weary to talk, and only munched biscuits, blinking and
      drowsing. And, when I woke again, the sun was far around and one of my
      ears full of sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Calhoun and I fell to talking&mdash;or he talked and I grunted mostly,
      with the pains in me; and it came upon me that we were in no small boy's
      trouble, and that, if we ever got out, I might ask people to call me a man
      and very likely they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody's after us hard just now, I take it,&rdquo; said Calhoun, &ldquo;unless
      they're all gone steamboating. It would be a good thing to get north of
      the Potomac, Bennie Ben, and the longer we're in Virginia the hotter it
      will be. For see here, now! Suppose the whole Confederacy gets to frothing
      at the mouth, and cavorting round like a crazy elephant, and shouting,
      'Who did up Cavarly? Ben Cree. Who messed his compass? Ben Cree. Where's
      Ben Cree? In Virginia.' And suppose the Confederacy comes stamping all
      over Virginia after you, neglecting the war shameful. What! Maybe they'd
      ask for me, too? Why, then we get out of this. That's our point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was so stiff with the night's tramp, and lame, so tied about and shot
      through with queer pains, coming from exposure, that I walked but a few
      steps, and fell down, and could not rise for the knots in my leg-muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm dead lame, Calhoun,&rdquo; I said with a sob. &ldquo;There's an awful pain going
      through me. I can't tramp again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came back and lifted me, putting his arm under my shoulder and saying,
      &ldquo;Why, you're a good man, Bennie, but we pushed hard last night,&rdquo; and so
      helped me slowly through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is oftentimes, in cities and among comfortable folk, that one hears
      talk of friendship; but I notice that, in the famous examples of this
      thing in old times, it always lay between men who saw trouble together,
      and maybe the open sky at night, and knew what it was to be two alone
      among enemies. For the man that you have been hungry with, and weary, and
      frightened, and comforted is never like other men to you again. And,
      though I suppose men may have friendship for each other for pleasant
      companionship, and that may be one kind; still, when they have walked
      together in narrow ways of fortune there comes to be another bond which is
      quite different.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much we were thinking of this new trouble and what would come of it,
      that we hardly looked before us on coming to the road till someone shouted
      quite near; and there were a mule team, resting in the shadow, a loaded
      waggon, and at either end Tommy Todd and the old, bent negro, Turpentine.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;THE DISMAL CANAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he waggon was
      loaded with barrels and bags, and plainly Mr. Todd was taking produce to
      some market. The great lean mules hung their heads and flopping ears hear
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiop!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd. &ldquo;Here you be! An' the cap'n pine blank mad like a
      teeter end hornet! Well, sirs, I'm s'prised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun went up calmly, as if he had naturally supposed Mr. Todd would be
      resting his mules about there. I remember that Calhoun once said to me:
      &ldquo;If a man expects corn for dinner, and finds it's turnips, what will he
      do? It depends on the man, Bennie. I generally eat turnips.&rdquo; And in the
      way of a figure of speech, he did, taking events easily, as they came to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going my way!&rdquo; said Calhoun, &ldquo;I declare! And here's Bennie Cree with
      cramps in his legs and crimps in his chest, just waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, get aboard,&rdquo; cried Mr. Todd. &ldquo;Get aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And presently we were riding comfortably, Calhoun beside Mr. Todd, and I
      on a bag behind that had something lumpy inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad, was he?&rdquo; said Calhoun. &ldquo;So as to miss his boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he. No, sir. But he went off r'arin' an' tearin' like he'd caught the
      Old Boy. He cer'nly did. He ac' rippanacious. He say you two Yanks fool
      him both ends, an' he'd plough up Vaginia an' sow grass seed but he'd get
      you. He did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offered a reward, did he? Say, about a hundred apiece. Course, he isn't
      foolish. More, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jemima! How&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Todd looked startled and suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left some of his men, too? Course he did. And if they catch us you don't
      get the reward. That's what's in it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiop! No, that's so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you bound for now, Mr. Todd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canal,&rdquo; said Mr. Todd, seeming a little subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to ship market stuff to Norfolk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a clean guesser,&rdquo; grumbled Mr. Todd. &ldquo;Cleanest I ever see. I was
      goin' to take it there myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Norfolk's blockaded. You're going to take a boat load by the Swamp
      Canal. Use your own mules, maybe. Good idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jemima!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd, &ldquo;you're a clean guesser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old negro sat on a barrel, looking down at me, so bent over that his
      solemn, wrinkled face, with its fringe of dusty grey beard, was near his
      knees. He gave a soft chuckle and motioned to the two men in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Tommy, he gettin' he min' wukkin'. Oomm! He studyin'! Don' git no
      fish 'way fom <i>him</i>. No-o-o!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to hug his knees with pleasure at thinking how clever Mr. Todd
      was about to be; and so we were believing very earnestly, both of us, each
      in the greater brilliancy of his own hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey's oodles an' oodles o' folks meek out dey play kiyi wi' Marse Tommy,
      an' hit tu'n out quar. I don' know, but hit peahs to me dey's pow'ful
      misfo'tu-nate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turpentine shook his head and chuckled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Calhoun, &ldquo;you're after that reward naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd, &ldquo;'tain't likely I'd get it, no, other folks bein'
      smarte'n me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose, being in trouble and seeing no other way out, we thought we
      might as well go to Norfolk with you and take our chances. Course, we'd
      try to slip you there. That would be our point. And your point would be to
      see we didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jemima!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd sarcastically. &ldquo;Ain't you fixin' things pretty
      nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, course, I don't know that we could get clear of you any better than
      we could Cavarly's men. Likely we'd slip up either way. We take our
      chances. But how's your point? Why, if Cavarly's men catch sight of us,
      they grab us. Course, they want the reward. Give and take's the rule. We
      give you a chance at the reward, and take a chance to cut loose, sort of
      exchanging commodities. Now, that's square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, my!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd with bland admiration, &ldquo;ain't it the beatenest
      thing, the way you go on makin' plans! Saves me a heap o' trouble. Ain't
      got a jackknife to trade for a mule, have ye? Jemima!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! I don' say nothin'.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha's it!&rdquo; said Turpentine softly. &ldquo;He don' say nothin'. Oomm! He min'
      wukkin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went on now jogging steadily, rather to the west than north, and the
      sand ridges, that had lain along between creek and creek, disappeared from
      the landscape. It was a continuous swampy country, a wall of reeds and
      matted briars on either side of the road, and great, gloomy trees standing
      apart, with mosses hanging. In breaks of the reeds there would be black
      pools, and creeks like ditches for the stillness of the water, secret,
      furtive, with twisted knees of cypress root sticking out of the banks, and
      half-sunken logs, from which the turtles plumped off solidly. The moss
      dripped, the very air was wet. The wind made always a hissing in the
      reeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was bad, full of deep holes, and sometimes made of uncertain
      logs, which the mules tiptoed over in an experienced manner. I learned to
      roll about with the waggon. Turpentine swung on his barrel like a
      weathervane, and seemed often to be going off into the reeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew dark, and the stars came out. The frogs were gulping about us.
      Turpentine crawled down from his barrel grumbling, and pulled out a
      blanket from below the seat; and I was glad to take a corner of it and be
      friendly, though neither of us made conversation, being fretful with the
      cold and damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went on many hours, all for the most part silently, and at last&mdash;but
      how late I do not know&mdash;drew up beside a house. Two or three other
      buildings were near, standing blackly in the night. There was a huge negro
      with a lantern, and a white man, lean and tall, who said, &ldquo;Howdy, Tommy.&rdquo;
       And after that I lay down somewhere on a corn-husk mattress, fever and
      aches for company, not thinking where we might be, or knowing till morning
      that we were come to the great canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat up in the dim morning, and looked about. It was a small, low room.
      Calhoun lay on a mattress against the door. It struck me with wonder and
      some shame, how careful he was, how watchful of little things. Yet for
      this matter, it seemed to me, if Mr. Todd had wished to make us prisoners
      there, he would have had no need to surprise us in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there were noises outside, and, when Calhoun woke, we rose and
      opened the door, which led into a kind of kitchen where a young woman in a
      neat apron was cooking. Outdoors we found Turpentine and the black giant I
      had seen the night before unloading the waggon into a canal boat, somewhat
      small, perhaps forty feet long. For the broad canal ran close to the
      house, with a wet, slippery tow path beside it. Mr. Todd was down in the
      hold of the boat, which seemed well laden, and, as I judged, for the most
      part, with garden stuff, fish in barrels, and vegetables in bags. But the
      middle of it was free for living in. I made out, by peering in, a pile of
      corn husks and straw for sleeping, and a stove with the pipe wired along,
      to take the smoke to where it could float up freely through the scuttle.
      The scuttle door was lifted back on hinges, and a padlock hung from it. A
      ladder ran down inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, where the woman with the apron sat at the head of the
      table, and Calhoun talked with the lean man and Mr. Todd, we went back to
      the boat, and found one of the mules at the tow rope, and the other
      aboard, tied forward. Mr. Todd took the helm. Turpentine started the tow
      mule, shouting at him, &ldquo;G'long now! You hyah me! I skin you toof.&rdquo; The
      young woman waved her apron from the door. But this seemed surprising,
      that the big negro, Gamp, did not go ashore but sat with his feet hanging
      down the scuttle, and his bulk of shoulders slouched forward. He seemed
      ready to go to sleep in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun looked at him a moment, then at Mr. Todd, and afterwards went
      fore, where he leaned against the rail whistling to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Gamp showed that Mr. Todd had surely been working his mind. Calhoun
      and I had no purpose to escape while in the Swamp, where we would be lost
      forever likely in its jungles and black gulfs. But Mr. Todd might think us
      desperate to that extent, and cause us to be tied up below by the
      monstrous black man, big enough to throttle an ox, and silent, and
      savage-eyed. For though I was stout for my age, and Calhoun a sinewy,
      enduring man, and both of us ready to fight, yet we could clearly do
      nothing with Gamp. Old Turpentine might count for little, but Mr. Todd
      seemed stronger, heavier than either of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went forward to Calhoun, and he was not cheerful, though it seemed to be
      not the prospect which troubled him so much, but that he suspected himself
      of a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man, Todd, Bennie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I figured him wrong. I didn't put him
      high enough. He's cornered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn't he make sure of us now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he'd rather keep things agreeable while he can. That's good sense.
      Why, he's figuring right. He's a better man than Cavarly. Why, look here!
      We can't light out into this swamp. The nigger'd corral us in ten
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun fell again into gloomy silence, staring at the wild, tangled, and
      hopeless jungle that slipped slowly past us. Old Turpentine was plodding
      ahead behind his mule, and even the hump of his stolid shoulders was discouraging.
      &ldquo;Folks meek out dey play kiyi wi' Marse Tommy. Peahs to me dey pow'ful
      misfo'tunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had grown almost to think Calhoun infallible with his courage and wits.
      It went hard with us both to have him beaten by that farmer and
      seine-fisher, with two negroes. It was Calhoun's pride&mdash;a weakness,
      if one chooses, at least what gave him most delight&mdash;to look at life
      and every experience as a kind of game, which he played to win, measuring
      himself with other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've pulled you into it, Bennie,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I shouldn't have done
      it. Cavarly'd have seen you out, if I'd let you alone to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not square,&rdquo; I said half angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't we go together? Anyhow I want my share. Why, Calhoun, I say&mdash;I
      don't like that talk. I say, you're all right with me, and I won't have
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun looked at me curiously and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake, Bennie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands secretly below the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing of importance came that day. We crawled through the same black
      water, past the same wet, tangled growth and towering dark trees, with
      sometimes a shift of mules, and sometimes Turpentine at the helm and big
      Gamp on the tow path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun and I went below before dark, with the hope of quieting Mr. Todd's
      mind, supposing him to be uneasy; and later, when the boat was fastened
      and the mule brought aboard, we all ate together, though saying little.
      Big Gamp took down the ladder and slept with his head on it. More
      threatening still it was that Mr. Todd lay with a shot gun across his
      knees, an odd-looking weapon, with a great lump of a hammer. So that I lay
      long awake, watching the dim red glimmer of the lantern, and listening to
      the hoarse breathing of the great negro. But my &ldquo;crimps and cramps&rdquo; were
      mainly gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed quietly, and so too the following morning. Mr. Todd
      carried his shot gun about, and said nothing. By afternoon we were out of
      the wilderness of swamp, for there were open fields in sight, and we
      passed under a bridge, and saw small shanties, and little pickaninnies
      fishing and playing about the tow path. And though the mouths of cannon
      were hot that day a few miles to the north, it was peaceful on the old
      canal boat, or appeared so. The water rippled, the tow rope sagged, and we
      lay about in the sun and were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the time of action came jump upon us, out of the quiet and the
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was just set; the canal boat had stopped; the tow mule was
      nibbling grass by the path. Mr. Todd stepped forward, gun in hand, and
      Gamp behind him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon we'll go below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Calhoun said, referring to Gamp and the gun:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to be about as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Below Turpentine had taken the top off the little stove and was frying
      something on the coals. Gamp shuffled into a corner, and came out with his
      fists full of rope, of the size of lanyards or clothesline, and his fists
      looked like quarters of beef or the ends of battering rams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I'm puttin' it to ye,&rdquo; said Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Todd, &ldquo;ain't I treated ye reasonable? But a man's got to be precautions,
      ain't he? Jemima! Such slippery chaps as you's not goin' to follow me into
      Norfolk same as trained pups.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your argument,&rdquo; said Calhoun, standing up straight and slim, &ldquo;is fine,
      sir, fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, my!&rdquo; said Mr. Todd soothingly. &ldquo;An' I see you an' me's goin' to
      agree. Business, jus' business. Gamp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamp shuffled up to Calhoun, and Mr. Todd turned to me. But now, so swift
      an impulse came over me to fight, to run, to leap into the midst of
      things, that it seemed like a flash and burst, an explosion within me; and
      I crouched, dodged Mr. Todd, and ran blind-headlong into old Turpentine.
      We fell together against the stove, sending it flying along the floor,
      with a crash of pipe and scatter of coals and burning wood all over the
      com husks and straw. I jumped for the ladder. The straw and husks blazed
      up behind me. Mr. Todd dropped his gun and ran into the midst of the flame
      and smoke, stamping and shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the top of the ladder I saw big Gamp dragging Calhoun by the collar,
      as if he weighed no more than an old coat, dragging him over the gun on
      the floor. Calhoun's hand touched the gun, and gripped it. How he twisted
      his feet under him I could not guess. It was something too limber and
      swift to follow. It seemed one movement to stand up, to swing the old gun
      two-handed with a crash on big Gamp's head, who dropped in a heap. The gun
      snapped, the butt spun across the floor, and Calhoun came up the ladder
      with the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught but a glimpse from the deck into the smoky red pit below, saw Mr.
      Todd stamping, saw big Gamp rising, with horrible, glaring eyes and
      dripping mouth, heard him roar like a bull from the bottom of his throat.
      Turpentine sat up on the floor, rubbing his scalp: &ldquo;An' mah name's
      Tuppentine.&rdquo; Then Calhoun slammed down the scuttle and slipped the
      padlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      We jumped for the shore and ran. There were woods beyond the tow path but
      a short distance, and no house was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll burn!&rdquo; I cried, as we reached the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn!&rdquo; said Calhoun. &ldquo;The nigger'll smash the scuttle with his finger.
      Burn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked over my shoulder, and half saw the great black head and shoulders
      heave up through the splintered scuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ran on through the open woods, circling towards the north. It was
      growing dusky, and, when we came to the open fields, it was dark enough
      for lights to be burning in a distant cluster of cabins. Then we found a
      railroad track running east and west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll hunt us this way!&rdquo; I said gasping, and Calhoun:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other side the canal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We ran westward along the track to a trestle-bridge over the canal, on
      which we crawled hands and knees, seeing stars reflected in the dark
      water, and beyond came at last upon a road that seemed to lead as we
      wished, under the pole star, northward, where should lie the blockading
      ships.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;WE COME TO A RIVER CALLED ELIZABETH, AND TO ANOTHER
      CALLED JAMES&mdash;CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e left the
      railroad behind us and took that northern highway. It was still early in
      the night when we passed a big plantation. There was a white house hack
      from the road, with pillars and lighted windows. We had slipped aside,
      hearing the sound of a galloping horse. It came up swiftly from the south,
      a white horse or light grey, and the rider turned him in at the wide gate
      into the shadows of the driveway. Then the front door went open: there
      were women's voices, and the cries of laughter, of children; the man ran
      up the steps, and the light from the hall shone on his grey uniform and
      braided bat; the door closed, and we plodded on in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond were cabins scattered in the fields, and presently a wood, and a
      little peak-roofed building close by the road, lighted and noisy with
      singing; and we slipped aside again, avoiding the light. It was a negro
      service. We could see the crowded black heads through the windows, and
      even hear the words of the hymn, following a queer, plaintive tune. The
      preacher on the platform shouted and swung his arms:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Oh, don' you heah the trumpet blow?
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Lulah! Lulah!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Don' you heah the trumpet blow?
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      All the mountains fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notheh!&rdquo; cried the preacher. &ldquo;Thank God foh' notheh! Don' drap 'im!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Someone meet me in the dark&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Lulah! Lulah!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Someone meet me in the dark,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Lif' me when I fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And we plodded on &ldquo;in the dark.&rdquo; The wood gave way to open flat fields,
      and glimmering sky, where the Dipper hung, with its pointers signaling the
      pole star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like we're most out of it, Bennie,&rdquo; said Calhoun; &ldquo;but you can't
      tell. I'm not figuring so much as I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's this way. Why, look at it! I figured the thing out, but it was
      you that flopped the ship around, and nothing in it but trouble for you.
      You had no use for it. And what made the old lady pull Tommy Todd off us?
      Not me. I didn't count on her at all. Then I figured us into the hold of
      Tommy Todd's canal boat in a bad way, and it was you bumped heads with
      Turpentine and fired Tommy Todd's bedding, sort of off-hand-how-d'ye-do;
      and I'd been figuring all day, like <i>x</i> plus <i>y</i>. Shucks! Flip a
      cent. Hear those niggers singing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did it mean, 'Meet me in the dark, Lift me when I fall,' and all
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know. Means you might quit figuring. It's too dark, this world, too
      dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;That other man was glad to get home,&rdquo; and Calhoun was silent. He
      seemed to be low in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a half-hour later that we heard again the galloping of a horse
      behind us. It came up and passed where we hid; it was the white horse or
      light grey; but if the rider had seen us and wished to see more, he
      misjudged his distance badly. He stopped far beyond, rode through the low
      bushes to the fence and looked over; then rode to and fro, peering about
      him, I suppose, for the light was not enough to be sure. But we heard the
      trampling of his horse too clearly, and he came as near as fifty feet;
      finally he turned into the road and went northward at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw no one any more, and all along the way the cabins and
      dwelling-houses were dark. It might have been three o'clock when we came
      upon a broad river or inlet, which the road followed closely from there
      on, circling around to the east along a bushy and swampy shore. Houses
      were frequent, piers running into the river, rowboats drawn among the
      reeds, sailboats anchored, piles of oyster shells, and the smell of the
      oyster trade everywhere. Calhoun thought the river should be the west
      branch of the Elizabeth River, and that Portsmouth and Norfolk should lie
      to the east a few miles. At last the opposite shore was quite lost, for we
      were come to the open tideway of the Elizabeth River, and there, somewhere
      across the water and through the dimness, lay the James and the northern
      ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was breaking now, with a thick mist on the river. Between the
      road and shore was a broad space of reeds and thick tangled undergrowth. A
      path led through it from the pier where the boats lay, and across the road
      to a large house, rather new and flimsy-looking, with long piazzas, and a
      sign, which I have heard read at that time, &ldquo;Smith's Hotel,&rdquo; but we did
      not go near enough to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went down the path to the boats, and thought out which to take when the
      time came, and found the place where the oars were thrust among the reeds,
      for a poor attempt to hide them, if that were meant. One of the boats was
      covered on the bottom with oysters in their knotted shells. We were glad
      enough of that, and carried maybe half a bushel into the thicket, and fell
      to breakfasting on them, feeling more cheerful, though raw oysters in a
      damp thicket of a misty morning are no luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke from a sleep, that I thought had been short and surely was
      uncomfortable, to hear a voice shouting from the path to someone down by
      the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, landlo'd!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Can I put up a bill on your post?&rdquo; and I
      thought it was familiar, but could not place it. Calhoun was motioning me
      to lie still. The steps of several men crunched the sand on the beach, and
      the speaker went to meet them. The &ldquo;landlo'd&rdquo; seemed to be deaf, and spoke
      very loudly himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha'd you say? What you got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They probably stood in a group at the end of the path, and the first
      speaker read his &ldquo;bill&rdquo; aloud, the others perhaps reading too, for I
      caught only certain words: &ldquo;Reward&mdash;forty years&mdash;slim, lively&mdash;boy&mdash;well
      grown&mdash;Redwood, South Ca'lina&rdquo;; and then it came upon me that he was
      reading a placard and description of Calhoun and me, and that himself was
      no other than Gerry, the steersman. That was unpleasant, but I wished he
      would read the description more clearly and read it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;tha's a circumstance, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be appealing to the others about him, for there was a murmur
      which amounted to agreement that it was a circumstance. &ldquo;Why, I'm
      reckonin' you're near the right track. Eh? Why, Major Sandfo'd&mdash;You
      know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Where'd you come from? Major Sandfo'd, Sandfo'd Plantation. He rode
      th'ough here las 'night; said your men came up by the canal an' got loose
      below his place somewhere an' mos' bu'nt up the canal boat. Eh? He said he
      thought he saw someone on the road, but mought a' been wrong, 'cause he
      met his niggers comin' f'om their-meetin', an' they tol' him nobody had
      passed. Niggers mought lie. Eh? But he didn' find 'em, if he saw 'em. But
      they came by the canal. Major said so. Don' you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all went up the path together making various comments, but the last I
      heard of Gerry's voice was when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetches us inside ten miles, don' it? Might a took the fork to
      Po'tsmouth. But you better watch your boats, landlo'd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone else said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot work down the river,&rdquo; meaning the cannonading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cannonading kept up its beat and thrill all through the afternoon. It
      was the 8th of March. We did not know anything peculiar about the 8th of
      March. There was an iron-sided thing careering around the James River the
      while, and eating up tall ships, and feeling much too comfortable over it.
      We were thinking about Gerry, and the landlord, and the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards dusk someone came stamping and puffing in the bushes, and we made
      out that he was come to hide the oars back among the brakes and leaves. We
      argued it must be the landlord, who seemed to be fat and short of wind, as
      well as deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited again a long time. Calhoun rose once and peered about, but lay
      down again and said there was still a light at the hotel. At last
      everything was dark and silent, so far as we could make out.
    </p>
    <p>
      We crept along till we found the oars, thrust here and there among the
      brakes, and took four of them, and so out into the starlight on the beach.
      I stepped into a boat, and Calhoun shoved the prow. But we had surely made
      a noise&mdash;some unnoticed clatter of oars&mdash;for the feet of men
      were coming now, thumping and stamping down the path. Calhoun shoved and
      leaped in, and we shot out over the shallow. But one of the men ran across
      the strip of beach into the water and caught the prow; and Calhoun thrust
      with his oar handle, so that he fell over and made a splash; and we got
      the oars in and rowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the landlord and two other men. The two others fell to shouting
      in the landlord's ear, &ldquo;Oars! oars!&rdquo; and all three ran into the bushes. We
      had gotten away so far that the shore was too dim to see, but I thought
      they had given up. Calhoun listened and heard their oarlocks. So we fell
      to, and pulled till my ears sang and my arms felt wooden, north by west,
      down the river, which was there broad like a bay; and we kept this pace
      some two miles, and were near the island they call Craney Island, where
      were Confederate batteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were good watermen. They out-rowed us fairly, drew nearer and nearer
      till I could see that there were two in the stem with an oar apiece, and
      the third man pulling two oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got no guns,&rdquo; said Calhoun. &ldquo;They'd have drawn on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I only gasped and grunted for answer. Calhoun stopped rowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you fight, Bennie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was almost a laugh in his voice, as if he were happy, like a little
      boy thinking of a fine new game. And somehow I was glad too, and cried,
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; feeling I would rather fight the Confederate batteries than pull
      through another half-hour so desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out in the river then. Let's have room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, when they caught us, we were near the middle of the river and far
      away from either shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoi!&rdquo; said the one in the prow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye would, would ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over to catch the stern of our boat. I stood up and swung my oar
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go easy, sonny,&rdquo; said one of those in the stem. &ldquo;You're wo'th money,
      wo'th money. Look out there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I brought the oar down with a flat slap on the first man's head, who
      pitched into the water, hitting our boat with his shoulder. And Calhoun
      pulled hard and sudden, so that I fell forward across my oar, and
      scrambled up very bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other boat had swung around with the shove of the man who went over,
      for he came up away from it. Either he could not swim or had lost his head
      with the blow, for he cried out and sank again: and one from the stem, but
      not the landlord, dove in, while the landlord howled words at us that had
      no sense except to express anger, which they did very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pulled away. I seemed to make out from the sounds that they were
      lifting the half-drowned man aboard, but we saw no more of them. Someone
      on Craney Island fired his gun off. It sounded very sharp and near. There
      was a light-boat ahead, marking the channel, and someone there who
      shouted; but we turned aside, and went far over to the right till we
      touched the reeds along the eastern shore, and so came out into the James.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a silent, dogged, weary space of time&mdash;of rowing and
      resting, and rowing again&mdash;dark water slapping the boat sides, and
      the same thing on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon rose late, and when there should have been dawn, came a mist
      instead, which was worse than the night, for now we might row past the
      ships and not see them, whereas in the dark we should have seen the
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came suddenly close to a tall ship: the watch heard us first, and
      called &ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; a voice dropping down from overhead in the white mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the <i>Saratoga?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lantern came down on a rope and stopped over us, and heads were thrust
      out over the rail. They seemed to be satisfied we were not dangerous; I
      think we did not look so, only two men in a small rowboat, with faces
      white and weary, who spoke in thin voices. I thought my voice sounded
      queer and dreary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the Saratoga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaped from the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; The heads consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the <i>Saratoga?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? The Saratoga lies two hundred yards astern of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Benson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Aye, Cap'n Benson.&rdquo; lanterns traveled and gathered to the stern of
      the ship to watch us move away. They looked like a cluster of dim stars in
      the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; the voice cried after us, and we stopped rowing. &ldquo;Are you Ben
      Cree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be dished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here is evidently where this story ends, since it is not a biography;
      for a story should know its own right beginning and end, just as a
      biography should not maunder over neighboring generations. The rest is
      only coming aboard the <i>Saratoga</i>&mdash;where I had a dim, weary
      notion of familiar faces, and went to sleep in a bunk, and woke to see
      Uncle Benson standing over me, very prim and natty. &ldquo;Well, Bennie!&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;it seems to me you've been out pretty late nights.&rdquo; And I had slept
      near a dozen hours, while the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i> were
      rubbing the muzzles of their cannon together, in plain sight from the <i>Saratoga's</i>
      deck, making a mess of naval warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun afterwards went off and enlisted, and fell in some Western
      fighting. Cavarly I have seen since, indeed not so long ago, and shaken
      hands with quite friendly, and Ben Cree has worn a captain's title these
      years and has wondered whether he ever deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For while a man is in the thick of his life he speculates little; he
      fights, he stays quiet, he runs, as seems best to his sense and suited to
      his feelings or the way he has been trained; he has few opinions on the
      subject, and those only fitting each event. Everything about him seems at
      that time but a stage, where he plays his part hastily and quite absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterwards he would like to think he has played his part well, and he
      hardly knows. Sometimes there is a bit of handclapping here and there, but
      the Author and Master of the play says nothing till it is all over and the
      curtain has fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks,&rdquo; Calhoun used to say, &ldquo;want to know everything before they've
      done anything. Why, Bennie, you don't know two and two make four till
      you've put 'em together. Why? Because they <i>don't</i> make four till
      you've put 'em together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know they <i>will</i> make four,&rdquo; I would answer for the
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;I've known a two and two that was as good as a
      dozen. And I've known another two and two that was worse than nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was an odd man whom I never understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I think if I were to choose one man to go with into the wilderness, it
      would be Calhoun and no other; and I suppose that is one kind of
      friendship, as the old poets declare. For the matter of knowing and doing,
      it is good arithmetic for a man to know how to put two and two together so
      as to make whatever he needs. That is Ben Cree's saying, the sense of
      which he learned from one Sabre Calhoun, when they lay out nights on sand
      or in undergrowth and watched the pole star hopefully.
